The csv's in this directory are saved output from BenchmarkHist_0111_DV.dss provided by Kirk Nelson in October 2017.
This dss file is saved on the server Z:\Active_Projects\018-01_CVPIA_Big_Data\Data\Hydrology\CALSIM-BiOp. 
All the nodes from part C = 'FLOW-CHANNEL' or 'FLOW-DELIVERY' and part B starting with a 'C' or 'D' were copied
into several csv's because the HEC viewer would crash when attempting to export all these nodes at once. 
Additionally the nodes from part B = 'DEL_SWP_TOTAL' and B = 'BEL_CVP_TOTAL' were copied into a csv. 
The 'clean_calsim.R' file is a script that will select the nodes of interest defined in 'cvpia_calsim_nodes.csv'
and rename them to fit the needs of generating model inputs for the SIT model.
