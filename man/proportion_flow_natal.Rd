\description{
A named list containing the proportion flows at tributary junction
coming from natal watershed using October CALSIM II flows. These proportions are used to estimate
straying in the CVPIA SIT Salmon Population Model. Each component of the list contains a dataset
with output from a different Calsim II run:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: output from the 2008-20019 Calsim II run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: output from the 2018-2019 Calsim II run.
}
}
\details{
The return flow proportion is calculated using the average October flow
in each watershed divided by the average October flow of the tributary it flows
into for each year of the simulation. These tributary relationships
are described in detail below.
